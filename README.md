# Covert_CVEP

# Main Idea
The goal of the project is to develop a novel gaze-independent brain-computer interface (BCI) based on code-modulated visual evoked potentials (C-VEP) for people living with late stage ALS. This repository contains code for the offline protocol of the said project.

# Contents
Contents: Different versions contain the various stages of the experimental paradigm and analyses scripts used for the project. 
1. **version 0**: preliminary experimental paradigm with parallel flashing with two classes. The stimuli displayed are the letters 'Y' and 'N'. 
2. **graz**: **This is the official folder for the submission made to the 2024 Graz BCI conference at TU Graz**. For a detailed overview of the experiment and analyses involved, refer to [arxiv]([url](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00031))
3. **version 2**: The most upto date script for the experiment will be found in version 2. The experiment consists of parallelly flashing stimuli containing 5 different shapes. The analysis folder now contains analyses for eye tracking data.
