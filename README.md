# Covert_CVEP

# Main Idea
The aim of this project is to create a **_covert_** code modulated Visual Evoked Potential (cVEP) experimental paradigm for a Brain Computer Interface Speller aimed at helping people with ALS using EEG. 
It aims to do so by eliminiating the need of eyetracking, since many who suffer from ALS do not have control over muscles responsible for ocular movements

# Experiment
Contents:
1. The codes or sequences used for flashing stimuli during the experiment
2. Images that are flashed
3. Python code for creating the stimulus and the paradigm


# Analysis
Contents:
1. Jupyter Notebook walkthrough for decoding the preprocessed neural activity into either of the two classes used.
2. Python code for preprocessing and extracting relevant vectors from raw EEG data.
