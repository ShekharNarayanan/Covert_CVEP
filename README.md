# Covert_CVEP

# Main Idea
The aim of this project is to create a **_covert_** code modulated Visual Evoked Potential (cVEP) experimental paradigm for a Brain Computer Interface Speller aimed at helping people with ALS using EEG. 
It aims to do so by eliminating the need for eye-tracking, since many who suffer from ALS do not have control over muscles responsible for ocular movements.

# Experiment
Contents:
1. The codes or sequences used for flashing stimuli during the experiment
2. Images that are flashed
3. speller.py (various):Python code for creating the experimental paradigms (square stimuli, circular stimuli and their extended sequential format versions)


# Analysis
Contents:
1. rCCA_Covert:
2. Decoding_Covert:
3. Power_Analysis_Covert:
4. read_cvep_data_shek: Python code for preprocessing and extracting relevant vectors from raw EEG data.
