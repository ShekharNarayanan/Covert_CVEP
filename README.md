# Contents
Contents: Different versions contain the various stages of the experimental paradigm and analyses scripts used for the project. The most upto date script for the experiment will be found in version 2
1. version 1: preliminary experimental paradigm with parallel flashing with two classes. The stimuli displayed are the letters 'Y' and 'N'. 
2. graz: This is the official folder for the submission made to the 2024 Graz BCI conference at TU Graz. For a detailed overview of the experiment and analyses involved, refer to [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00031](url)
3. 3. version 2: The most upto date script for the experiment will be found in version 2. The experiment consists of parallelly flashing stimuli containing 5 different shapes. The analysis folder now contains analyses for eye tracking data.
