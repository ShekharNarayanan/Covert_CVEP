# Covert_CVEP

# Main Idea
The aim of this project is to develop a **_covert_** code modulated Visual Evoked Potential (cVEP) brain computer interface (BCI) speller aimed at helping people with ALS communicate. The end goal is to eliminating the need for eye-tracking in an online protocol, since many who suffer from ALS do not have control over muscles responsible for ocular movements.
