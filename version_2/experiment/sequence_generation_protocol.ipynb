    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**[1]**: The sequence sets (cued and non cued) are 1-1 mapped. This means that for an ith cued sequence, the conditions of adjacency, simultaneity (see matching_indices function) and target placement are met ONLY for the corresponding ith non_cued sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook will use the terms \"cued\" and \"non_cued\" sequences throughout. The \"cued\" sequences are the shape sequences that the subject will covertly/overtly pay attention to during a trial, and the \"non_cued\" sequences are the sequences that are not attended to. This terminology is limited to an offline protocol. In an online protocol, there will be no such difference as the cued and non_cued sequences. Target balancing (see next explanation section) will then be done for both categories of sequences."
